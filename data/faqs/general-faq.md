# IT Helpdesk - Frequently Asked Questions

## Password Reset
**Q: How do I reset my password?**
A: Go to the SSO portal at sso.company.com, click "Forgot Password", and follow the email verification steps. Your new password must be at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character. If you're locked out, contact the helpdesk at ext. 4357.

## VPN Access
**Q: How do I connect to the company VPN?**
A: Download the GlobalProtect client from the software portal. Use your corporate credentials to log in. Select the "Corporate-VPN" gateway. If you get a certificate error, make sure your system clock is correct and try again. For Mac users, you may need to approve the system extension in Security & Privacy settings.

## Email Setup
**Q: How do I set up email on my phone?**
A: For iPhone: Go to Settings > Mail > Accounts > Add Account > Microsoft Exchange. Enter your work email and password. For Android: Open Gmail > Settings > Add Account > Exchange. Your server is outlook.office365.com. Enable two-factor authentication first through the MFA portal.

## Software Installation
**Q: How do I request new software?**
A: Submit a request through the IT Service Portal at itportal.company.com. Select "Software Request", choose from the approved catalog, or submit a custom request with business justification. Standard approvals take 1-2 business days. Non-standard software requires manager and security team approval (5-7 business days).

## Printer Setup
**Q: How do I add a network printer?**
A: On Windows: Settings > Printers & Scanners > Add a printer. On Mac: System Preferences > Printers & Scanners > click +. Search for the printer by name or IP. All floor printers follow the naming convention FLOOR-WING-TYPE (e.g., 3N-EAST-COLOR). Driver installation is automatic on managed devices.

## Wi-Fi Issues
**Q: The office Wi-Fi isn't working. What should I do?**
A: First, forget the network and reconnect. Corporate devices should auto-connect to "Corp-Secure" using certificate authentication. Guest devices use "Guest-WiFi" with the lobby password (rotated weekly). If issues persist, check if other devices are affected — if so, report to helpdesk as it may be an infrastructure issue.

## Hardware Requests
**Q: How do I request new hardware (laptop, monitor, etc.)?**
A: Submit a hardware request through the IT Service Portal. Standard laptop refresh cycle is every 3 years. Monitors, keyboards, and mice can be requested as needed. Emergency replacements for broken hardware are processed within 24 hours. All requests require manager approval for items over $500.

## Two-Factor Authentication
**Q: How do I set up MFA/2FA?**
A: Visit mfa.company.com and log in with your credentials. You can register: (1) Microsoft Authenticator app (recommended), (2) SMS to your verified phone, or (3) a hardware security key. We require at least two methods registered for redundancy. MFA is required for VPN, email, and all cloud services.
