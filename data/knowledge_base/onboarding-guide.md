# New Employee IT Onboarding Guide

## Day 1 Checklist
1. **Collect your laptop** from IT (Building A, Room 102). Bring your employee ID.
2. **Log in** with the temporary credentials in your welcome email. You'll be prompted to change your password.
3. **Set up MFA** at mfa.company.com — register at least two authentication methods.
4. **Connect to Wi-Fi**: Your laptop will auto-connect to "Corp-Secure" after initial setup.
5. **Install required software**: Open the Software Center app. The following are auto-installed:
   - Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
   - Slack Desktop
   - Zoom
   - Company VPN (GlobalProtect)
   - 1Password (password manager)

## Week 1 Tasks
- Complete the **Security Awareness Training** in the Learning Portal (mandatory, due within 7 days).
- Set up **email on your phone** if needed (see FAQ).
- Request access to **team-specific tools** through the IT Service Portal (e.g., Jira, GitHub, Figma, AWS Console).
- Join the **#it-help** Slack channel for quick IT questions.

## Common First-Week Issues
- **"My account is locked"**: Wait 30 minutes or call helpdesk at ext. 4357.
- **"I can't access [tool]"**: Most tools require a separate access request. Check with your manager for which tools your role needs.
- **"My laptop is slow"**: Initial setup runs Windows Updates and security scans. Performance improves after 24-48 hours.
- **"I didn't get a welcome email"**: Contact HR at hr@company.com to verify your email was provisioned.
