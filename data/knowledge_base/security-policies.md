# Information Security Policies

## Acceptable Use Policy
All employees must use company IT resources responsibly. Personal use is permitted within reason but must not interfere with work duties or violate any policies. Prohibited activities include: accessing inappropriate content, cryptocurrency mining, unauthorized data sharing, and using company resources for personal business ventures.

1. Email: security@company.com
